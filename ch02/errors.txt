M = mistake
U = unclear
T = typo
E = text change
C = comment

(E) Pg. 1 "you use to create Puppet configuration" ->
"you use to create Puppet configurations"

(M) Pg. 1  “licensed as Apache 2.0” -> “licensed under the Apache 2.0
license”
This appears correctly in the section about "Facter and Facts".

(U) Pg. 2 "The Puppet master runs as a daemon on a host and contains the
configuration required for the specific environment.”
This is poor wording. What does "the configuration required for the
specific environment” mean?

(T) Pg. 4 ".apt-get install vim” -> "apt-get install vim”

(T) Pg. 5 "on Red Hat it would execute yum"
"execute" should not be in italics.

(E) Pg. 6 "Puppet configuration can be safely run" ->
"Puppet can be safely run"

(M) Pg. 7 "The first caveat is that the master needs to be a later
release than the agents.” ->
"The first caveat is that the master needs to be the same or a later
release than the agents.”

(T) Pg. 9 "On Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, SUSE/SLES, Debian and Ubuntu,
this package is called rubygems.” ->
"On Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, SUSE/SLES, Debian, and Ubuntu, this package
is called rubygems.”

(T) Pg. 10 "RubyGems or Source" ->
"RubyGems or source"

(M) Pg. 19 "and C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\puppet\etc\" ->
"and C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\puppet\etc\puppet.conf"

(E) Pg. 19 "Once we've configured appropriate DNS for Puppet" ->
"Once we've configured appropriate DNS entries for Puppet"

(E) Pg. 20 "This directory and file is often already created when the
Puppet packages are installed. If it hasn’t already been created, create
this directory and file now” ->
"This directory and file are often already created when the Puppet
packages are installed. If they haven’t already been created, create
this directory and file now”

(E) Pg. 21 "Starting the daemon will initiate" ->
"Starting the daemon will initialize"

(T) Pg. ? "puppet agent --test --server= puppet.pro-puppet.com” ->
"puppet agent --test --server=puppet.pro-puppet.com”
(On Safari online only)

(M) Pg. 22 "with three options. The first option, --server," ->
"with three options. The second option, --server,"

(T) Pg. 23 "in the main section" ->
"in the [main] section"

(T) Pg. 23 "your client).The" ->
"your client). The"

(E) Pg. 23 "The agent sends the certificate request" ->
"The agent sends the certificate signing request"

Pg. ? "This configuration is called waitforcertand is” ->
"This configuration is called waitforcert and is”
(On Safari online only)

(U) Pg. 26 In Listing 1-7 there are two node definitions for ‘node1’.
The text doesn’t
make it clear why an. A FQDN name is shown in one definition and just
a hostname is shown in the other.

(C) Pg. 26 Parameterized classes is too important a concept to be
brushed over.
Just a short description only confuses readers.

(M) Pg. 28 "check the value of the operatingsystem fact" ->
"check the value of the osfamily fact"

(U) Pg. 28 "relationship between the Package["sudo-ldap"] resource"
The listing show the "package {"sudo-ldap ...}" syntax. A new
user won't know why Package has an upper case first letter. This problem is
also present in many places in Ch. 2. It's first explained on Pg. 47.

(E) Pg. 28 "allows Puppet to retrieve a file from the Puppet source" ->
"allows Puppet to retrieve a file from the Puppet server"

(E) Pg. 28 "is the name of the Puppet source" ->
"is the name of the Puppet server"

(E) Pg. 30 "By default, will Puppet use this cache” ->
"By default, Puppet will use this cache”

(U) Pg. 34 "Be sure you've installed the base operating system on these
hosts as described
in Chapter 1".
Chapter 1 doesn't describe how to install operating systems. It
describes how to
install Puppet.

(C) Pg. 34 Including the necessary Kickstart configuration to bootstrap
Puppet is an
excellent idea. However, the text should have noted that the example
only works on
Debian-derived operating systems. Better yet, the text should also
include a sample
configuration that works on RedHat-derived operating systems.

(T) Pg. 35 Listing 2-2 “wll” -> “will”

(C) Pg. 35 "/etc/puppet/manifests/"
Is the convention going to be to include the final slash in directory
pathnames?
If so, Pg. 26, and probably others, has examples that need to be fixed.
If not,
then Pg. 35, and probably others, needs to be fixed.

(C) Pg. 37 The concept of "dynamic scoping" is mentioned several times
in this
chapter. This is not a widely understood concept. The text should
include an example
illustrating dynamic scoping.

(U) Pg. 38 "Each class, definition, or node introduces a new scope".
The concept of a "definition" hasn't been explained yet. Mentioning it here
only causes confusion. It isn't defined until Pg. 64.

(U) Pg. 38 "imported manifests". The concept of "importing" hasn't been
defined yet.
New readers will be confused about the difference between "including"
and "importing".

(U) Pg. 38 "thus preventing the variable from being overwritten anywhere"
I don't think this describes the issue. As I understand it, explicitly
using top-scope
variables prevents variables with similar names from other than
top-scope from
accidentally being referenced.

(E) Pg. 38 "no way to explicitly retrieve it" ->
"no way to explicitly reference variables defined in node scope"

(T) Pg. 38 "is a way of writing the $sshd_package variable"
"the" should not be in a different font.

(U) Pg. 38 "will still be defined in local scope"
Local scope hasn't been defined yet. In fact, it's defined in the next
sentence.

(U) Pg. 39 All of a sudden, variable names are shown that don't begin
with a '$'.  Why? This should either be changed or explained. (I know it
has to do with parameterized classes but they haven't been explained yet).

(U) Pg. 39 "classes that take parameters when they are called"
Classes are included, not called.

(U) Pg. 40 An example of a parameterized class is shown at the top of
the page.
As I've said above, this concept needs much more explanation, both
syntactically
and semantically.

(E) Pg. 41 "our sudo module contains the lines shown" ->
"our sudo module contains the files and directories shown"

(E) Pg. 42 "in the form of a revision" ->
"in the form of a revision or commit"

(E) Pg. 43 "execute the git binary" ->
"run git"

(U) Pg. 43 "We can now add files to this repository"
The 'git add' command doesn't add files to a repository. 'git commit' does.

(T) Pg. 43 "we can see what Git is about by using the git status command" ->
"we can see what Git is about to do by using the git status command"

(C) Pg. 43 This is not a very clear description of Git.

(E) Pg. 43 "numeric numbers" ->
"numbers"

(M) Pg. 44 The ssh class definition refers to the ::ssh::package class
but no such
class exists. This reference should be to the ::ssh::install class

(M) Pg. 45 "and used the include function to add all the classes"
There are no includes shown in Listing 2-13.

(M) Pg. 45 "We’ve created three classes: ssh, ssh::install, ssh::config,
and ssh::service.” ->
"We’ve created four classes: ssh, ssh::install, ssh::config, and
ssh::service."

(M) Pg. 46 "/etc/puppet/modules# find." ->
"/etc/puppet/modules# find ."

(M) Pg. 46 "./ssh/manifests/package.pp" ->
"./ssh/manifests/install.pp"

(M) Pg. 46 "manifests as a variable called $osfamily" ->
"manifests as a variable called $::osfamily"

(M) Pg. 46 "Let's rewrite our ssh::package class" ->
"Let's rewrite our ssh::install class" . Also, "our" should
not appear in console font.

(M) Pg. 47 "In the preamble of the ssh::params class" ->
"In the preamble of the ssh::install class"

(M) Pg. 56 "placed inside brackets the name" ->
"placed inside parentheses the name"

(T) Pg. 57 "lensure => running," ->
"ensure => running,"

(E) Pg. 58 "And add the files" ->
"And add the files and directory"

(C) Pg. 59 I've never heard of a "brick" module.

(T) Pg. 61 " group => 'root'," ->
"group => 'root',"
(the leading space is removed).

M = mistake
U = unclear
T = typo
E = text change
C = comment

(E) Pg. 73 "integration with VCS" ->
"integration with our VCS"

(C) Pg. 74 The meaning of the '-e' option is never described. The examples make
it
easy to guess what it means but it should still be described in at least a
little detail.

(C) Pg. 74 "the notify function is much more forgiving about its inputs". If
you're going to
the trouble of showing the differences between notify and notice, and state that
one is more
forgiving than the other, you should show some examples of how this is true.

(T) Pg. 75, Listing 3-3 "file { '/tmp/redhsirt/logan':" ->
"file { '/tmp/redshirt/logan':"

(T) Pg. 75 "on the '/tmp/redshirt/logan' file resource" ->
""in the '/tmp/redshirt/logan' file resource""

(C) Pg. 75 Some background on puppetlabs-stdlib should be given. Why does it
exist? What does it do?

(M) Pg. 75 There needs to be some text added between Listing 3-5 and Listing 3.6
that
mentions creating the file puppet_example.pp. Otherwise, it looks like
puppet_example.pp
just pops out of nowhere.

(M) Pg. 75 For Listing 3.7 to work, Listing 3.5 should include a 'cd ~/testing'
command.

(U) Pg. 75 Should the '--modulepath' option in Listing 3-7 be
/root/testing/stdlib? If not, why
not? What would happen if there were other modules under /root/testing that we
didn't
want to be seen in by the puppet apply command?

(U) Pg. 76 In the previous chapter we were shown that /etc/puppet/manifests
contains site.pp,
and that modules go under /etc/puppet/modules. Yet, Listing 3-8 shows the ssh
module in
the same directory as site.pp. You should mention that this organization is
different than what
was shown before, but that supplying a specific directory to --modulepath makes
this all work.

(U) Pg. 77 "bare-bones site.pp file that simply includes the ssh class."
This is unclear because there's no include statement in Listing 3-8. There needs
to be a discussion of the difference between "class { 'xxx'}" and  "class xxx
{}"

(U) Pg. 78 "This scenario has a Hiera component"
Where and what is that component? It isn't obvious from what follows.

(C) Pg. 78 The layout of /etc/puppet would be much clearer if the output of the
'tree' command (or similar) were used.

(T) Pg. 78 "full copy of the site.pp" ->
"full copy of site.pp"

(C) Pg. 79 "The puppet agent run syncs facts"
Is "sync" the right word to use? In this example, maybe "loads facts" would be
better since that's what Listing 3-16 shows.

(U) Pg. 79 "other pluginsync artifacts"
Plusingsync artifacts haven't been mentioned before.

(T) Pg. 79 "The other windows, containing" ->
"The other window, containing"

(E) Pg. 80 "as an rsync of /etc/puppet" ->
"as an rsync of /etc/puppet from the real Puppet master"

(U) Pg. 80 "you won't have to push trust into an untrusted virtual machine"
What does this mean?

(T) Pg. 80 "a virtualization middleware" ->
"virtualization middleware"

(E) Pg. 80 "makes starting, logging into, destroying, and repeating the process
smooth" ->
"makes starting, logging into, and destroying a virtual machine smooth and
easily repeatable"

(C) Pg. 80 "Vagrant is a collection of Ruby scripts that wrap software
hypervisors"
Vagrant is much more than that. Plus, it doesn't wrap a hypervisor.

(T) Pg. 80 "Vagrant workflow" ->
"A Vagrant workflow"

(T) Pg. 80 "a vagrant virtual machine template" ->
"a Vagrant virtual machine template"

(E) Pg. 80 "of your production server load" ->
"of your production server configuration"

(E) Pg. 80 "Vagrant machine" ->
"Vagrant virtual machine"
(This occurs in several places)

(M) Pg. 80 The example showing how to create autosign.conf needs to somehow
show what directory this file should be in.

(T) Pg. 81 In Listing 3-17 should there be a line that starts with ".box". This
looks like a typo. Also, the "The box you're attempting ..." line should be
removed.
New Vagrant users won't see it.

(U) Pg. 84 Why isn't putting everything under /etc/puppet into a repo a
third option in the Maintenance of Modules section?

(E) Pg. 85 "to do such smart behavior" ->
"to act so intelligently"

(C) Pg. 89 You must have used an old version of git in these examples. Newer
version
use the singular noun when just 1 item has been changed (e.g. '1 files' vs. '1
file')

(T) Pg. 89 The line starting "You cloned" should appear as a bulleted item just
like the other
4 items.

(U) Pg. 89 "the Puppet configuration on a node configures the environment that
the node uses"
This is unclear. For example, so far we've only seen environments configured in
a Puppet master's
puppet.conf files. Yet, this statement implies that environments can appear on
Puppet client
nodes also. Or, does this sentence only apply in masterless environments? This
seem unlikely because
the next sentence says "The Puppet master does not directly control which
environment a machine connects
to". Thus, there is indeed a Puppet master. In any case, this Tip badly need
clarification.

(T) Pg. 91 "Addeddocs comment" ->
"Added docs comments"

(E) Pg. 92 "and submit their" ->
"and commit their"

(E) Pg. 92 "and check out the branch" ->
"and check out the testing branch"

(E) Pg. 92 "Merge branch into master" ->
"Merge testing branch into master"

(T) Pg. 92 "Merge branch into master with local clone, push" ->
"Merge the branch into master on the local clone and push"

(T) Pg. 92 "and checks out" ->
"and check out"

(T) Pg. 93 "via post-receive hook" ->
"via a post-receive hook"

(T) Pg. 93 "from a central repository" ->
"from the central repository"
(This is correct on Pg. 92)

(T) Pg. 93 "Make changes, and then push a testing branch named feature1" ->
"Make changes and then push a testing branch named feature1 to the central
repository"
(Again, follow the same style as on Pg. 92)

(T) Pg. 93 "following action" ->
"following actions"

(E) Pg. 93 "issue puppet --test --environment=feature1" ->
"run puppet --test --environment=feature1"

(E) Pg. 93 "Merge the branch feature1 into the master, and put it to the Git
server" ->
"Merge the branch feature1 into into the master on the local clone and push to
the central repository"

(C) Pg. 93 The word "folder" is used in several places. Previously, the word
"directory" had been used. One or the other should be used consistently.
I vote for "directory".

(E) Pg. 93 "done by a script" ->
"done by the post-receive hook"

(U) Pg. 93 "all Git branches that aren't master/production are testing branches"
This needs to be reworded. What does "master/production" mean?

(E) Pg. 93 "modern coding" ->
"modern version control"

(E) Pg. 94 "expands out" ->
"expands"

(U) Pg. 94 "minimally configured nodes"
What does this mean?

(U) Pg. 94 "you should run the master branch of your Git repository under the
name production"
This is very awkward. How about "you should change the default branch of your
Git repository to production"?
By the way, is what's shown in Listing 3-40 really the best way to do this?

(C) Pg. 94 The reader will have no idea what a YAML back-end is. In fact, this
whole paragraph
will make no sense. I suggest moving it to Chapter 12.

(E) Pg. 95 "of the Puppet manifests Git repository" ->
"of the Git repository containing the Puppet manifests"

(T) Pg. 95 "two component hook" ->
"two-component hook"

(E) Pg. 95 "bounce" ->
"restart"

(E) Pg. 95 "error is that displayed" ->
"error is displayed"

(E) Pg. 96 "PuppetSync" ->
"The puppet-sync module"

(E) Pg. 96 "simultaneously and in parallel" ->
"simultaneously"

(U) Pg. 96 "Rebase against the master branch"
This wasn't shown in the text.

(U) Pg. 96 What's a "dynamic environment"?
